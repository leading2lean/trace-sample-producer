## Sample use of the Trace SDK

This is a small factory that will produce items for a fictitious engine factory.
The engine parts are customizable through manipulation of the parts and subcomponents
outlined in the config.yaml file. Copy the sample_config.yaml file to config.yaml,
customize to your needs and then you're ready to run.
